	<h1>Welcome - Inside the Ark</h1>
	<h2>Do you know the story?</h2>
	<h3><i>Let me tell you real quick...</i></h3>
	<p>Noah labored faithfully to build the Ark 
	at God's command, ultimately saving not only 
	his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood. 
	Afterwards, God made a covenant with him and promised never again to destroy all the earth's 
	creatures with a flood.
	</p>
	<p>Everyone is striving, walking, <i>living</i> throughout this harsh world, <b>with their own Ark</b>. <br>
		and inside, there is a <b>Village</b>.</p> 
	<p><i>Your own, sweet Village revolving around you.</i></p>
	<p>Let us help your village flourish with vigor and full beauty. </p>
	<p>Let us protect your village unharmed, however harsh outside that Ark is.</p>
	<h3>Now please, could you show us your beautiful village?</h3>
